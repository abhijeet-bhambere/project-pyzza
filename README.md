These notebooks are my learnings from The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python by Jose Portilla.
Being one of the most popular courses on Python , the course helped establish a solid foundation in basics of the programming language. It then introduced to various functions/ methods - both in-built as well as custom, libraries & various peculiarites that make Python one of the most popular languagees

I divided the Python pathway into a 'Learning' phase and then into a 'Building Phase'. I ensured that I invested sufficient time in the Learning Phase - to get a first-hand understanding of all aspects of the language before turning the focus on data analytics-related topics (more on that soon!) . 
As for the Building phase , this is a work in progress & I'll be uploading a few projects that I have built soon. Togther with the learnings from the Pandas & SQL, my aim is to build a few projects that display end-to-end process used commonly in data analytics.  


_P.S.:The name is misnomer-ed project to learn python, from a to z_
